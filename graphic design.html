        <h1>How I Built My Instagram Audience: A Lesson of Athenticity</h1>
    <p>While you might think that Instagram is only a visual platform, it's more a place for storytelling and authentic branding. Here's my story.</p>

        <p>When it comes to blogs, you want to make sure that you’re not too general in your body copy. If you’re thinking about a content marketing strategy, the better you tailor your content to your audience, the better engagement you will get. Having a niche helps, because that way you can really narrow down your content.</p>
        <p>How you’re marketing your blog is another thing that’s important to remember when you’re starting out with your blog. While it takes a while to start dominating the search engines and search results, introducing a mailing list to announce the newest blog post is a great idea to drive traffic to your website and blog.</p>
        <h2>THIS IS A SUB-HEADING</h2>
        <p>Harness the power of social media, too: not only can you easily talk back and forth with your audience, but it’s also a great tool for marketing.</p>
        <p>When you’re setting up your social media accounts, check that you can use the same or a very similar version of your website’s domain as your account handle. This will make it easier for your audience to remember you, no matter which platform you’re using.</p>
        
        <h2>THIS IS A SUB-HEADING</h2>
        <p>Your blog posts are a great way to communicate what happens behind the scenes of your business to people who follow your brand and buy your products. It's also a good space to share insights and expertise on how to get the most out of your products or to simply share tips and tricks on how to succeed more broadly in the niche that you're in.</p>
        
        <h2>THIS IS A SUB-HEADING</h2>
        <p>To start, simply pick a topic and start brainstorming different headlines around it. Once you can pinpoint the main ideas that you want to cover in your blog posts, you can start thinking about what the keywords for each would be. If you're new to this, think about what people would be typing to Google if they were to search for your blog post.</p>
        
        <p>Use an AI Writer if you're stuck for words when you get writing, and to top your blog post off, it's fun to make use of blog title generators to come up with a unique yet eye-catching title. Because the better your blog post title is, the more likely you are to grab the visitor's attention and get them to read on.</p>
